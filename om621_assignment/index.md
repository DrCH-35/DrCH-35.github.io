OM 621 — Advanced Tools & Technologies for Business Analytics
Course Overview

This page presents my analytical work for OM 621: Advanced Tools and Technologies for Business Analytics.
The course emphasized using Python, Power BI, and structured communication to develop end-to-end analytical workflows that support strategic and operational decision-making.

My work in this course includes:
A business-focused 3-minute story and storyboard
A fully integrated Python analysis notebook (Assignments 2 & 3 combined)
Data preparation, transformation, and exploratory analysis
Feature development and visualization
An interactive Power BI dashboard
A video walkthrough demonstrating the final solution

Assignment 1 — Three-Minute Story & Storyboard
The goal of this assignment was to transform complex analytical work into a straightforward, compelling narrative for a non-technical audience.
Three-Minute Story Summary
My story addressed a real-world transportation analytics challenge involving variability in delays and cost behavior across different shipping modes.
The narrative was structured around three core questions:

What happened?
Analysis revealed operational delays and unpredictable cost fluctuations across transportation modes.
Why did it happen?
Exploratory analysis showed that distance, mode characteristics, and lead-time inconsistency were the primary contributors.
Why does it matter?
These issues directly impact inventory planning, service reliability, and total cost of operations.
Better forecasting and monitoring enable organizations to optimize resources and reduce waste.

Storyboard Highlights
The storyboard served as a framework for communicating the analysis visually:
Problem introduction: The challenge of cost predictability and delay variability
Data landscape: Key datasets and relevant variables
Insight progression: Visual patterns, comparisons, and statistical findings

Recommendations: Strategies for improving operational performance
Future direction: Additional analyses enabled through advanced tools
This structure guided the progression of the Python and Power BI analytics.
Assignments 2 & 3 — Integrated Python Analytics
Assignments 2 and 3 were consolidated into a single notebook to demonstrate a full analytical process from raw data to insight.

1. Data Preparation
Importing datasets
Cleaning and formatting fields
Standardizing data types
Creating additional calculated fields
Organizing the data for modeling and visualization

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization of distributions and outliers
Comparison of transportation mode behavior
Summary statistics identifying key performance differences
Detection of high-variance patterns that influence cost and delay predictions

3. Feature Engineering
Development of analytic indicators, such as delay duration and normalized cost comparisons
Creation of fields supporting forecasting and dashboard analytics

4. Key Insights
Transportation modes exhibited significantly different performance patterns
Delay variability emerged as a major driver of total landed cost
Visual analysis confirmed structural differences across mode types
Findings support operational decision-making related to mode selection and forecasting

The combined notebook serves as a complete analytical workflow, demonstrating technical competence and a reproducible methodology.
Power BI Dashboard — Interactive Visualization
Power BI was used to extend the analysis beyond Python by offering an interactive, executive-ready environment.

The dashboard includes:
Trends in transportation costs
Delay distribution visuals
Forecast models leveraging Power BI analytics
Mode-level performance comparisons
Interactive filters for scenario exploration
These visuals help decision-makers quickly interpret patterns and evaluate cost-to-performance tradeoffs.
