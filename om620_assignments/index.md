# OM 620 — Business Analytics Assignments

This page summarizes my work for **OM 620: Tools and Technologies for Business Analytics**.  

It includes data cleaning and preparation files, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Jupyter notebooks and visualizations, and a combined notebook that integrates Assignments 1 and 2.

## Assignment 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Loaded and explored the dataset
Cleaned and prepared the data
Generated descriptive statistics
Built visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots)
Identified key patterns, trends, and outliers

## Assignment 2 — Data Cleaning & Transformation
Skills demonstrated:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, descriptive statistics, data visualization

## Assignment 2 focused on data quality and preprocessing:
Skills demonstrated:
Data cleaning workflows, Pandas transformation tools, reproducible data preparation

## Combined Notebook — Assignments 1 & 2
The file Assignments_1_and_2_Combined.ipynb integrates both assignments into a single, continuous workflow:
Raw data → cleaned data → exploratory analysis
Shows an end-to-end analytics pipeline

Throughout OM 620, I strengthened skills in:
Python programming
Jupyter Notebook
Data cleaning and transformation (Pandas, NumPy)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Structuring analytics projects
Documentation and clear communication of findings


This project demonstrates my ability to:
Analyze real datasets end-to-end.
Produce a clean, replicable analytical workflow.s
Organize work professionally using GitHub.
Communicate analytical results effectively.

The OM 620 project supports my broader path in supply chain analytics, data-driven decision-making, and organizational improvement.
