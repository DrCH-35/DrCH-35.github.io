# Milestone II — How I Created My GitHub E-Portfolio

## Introduction
This document explains how I created my professional e-portfolio hosted at [https://DrCH-35.github.io](https://DrCH-35.github.io).  
It provides the step-by-step actions I took, screenshots I captured, and helpful resources I used.  

---

## Step 1 — Creating a GitHub Account
I began by creating an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) using my academic email address.  
After setting up two-factor authentication, I customized my profile with a profile picture and display name **C. Hardin**.

---

## Step 2 — Creating the Repository
Next, I created a public repository named: DrCH-35.github.io
This specific naming convention is required for GitHub Pages to recognize the repository as a personal website.  
I initialized the repository with a **README.md** and selected the **MIT License**.

---

## Step 3 — Activating GitHub Pages
Inside my repository, I went to:
Settings → Pages → Build and Deployment
- Selected the `main` branch  
- Choose the root directory `/ (root)`  
- Clicked **Save**

After a few minutes, my site became available at [https://DrCH-35.github.io](https://DrCH-35.github.io).

## Step 4 — Setting Up the Theme
I created a configuration file called `_config.yml` to define the site theme and title:

```
title: "C. Hardin's E-Portfolio"
description: "A professional showcase of my work, leadership, and academic projects."
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
This file allows GitHub Pages to render the Markdown files with the Minimal Jekyll Theme.

---
## Step 5 - Creating the Homepage
I edited the existing **index.md** file to introduce my portfolio.
I added my name, a short biography, and links to my résumé and projects.
# Welcome to My E-Portfolio
Hello, my name is Clarisa Hardin, and this e-portfolio showcases my educational journey, leadership experience, and professional growth.
I then committed the changes to see them appear live on my website.

---
## Step 6 — Adding Other Pages
I created two additional pages:
**portfolio.md** — to describe my academic and professional projects
**resume.md** — to provide a brief résumé summary
Each file uses Markdown headings and links for easy navigation.
