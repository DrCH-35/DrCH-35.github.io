## Milestone II â€” How I Created My GitHub E-Portfolio
Introduction
This document explains how I created my professional e-portfolio hosted at https://DrCH-35.github.io.
It provides the step-by-step actions I took, screenshots I captured, and helpful resources I used.

---

## Step 1 â€” Creating a GitHub Account
I began by creating an account on GitHub using my academic email address.
After setting up two-factor authentication, I customized my profile with a profile picture and display name C. Hardin.

---

## Step 2 â€” Creating the Repository
Next, I created a public repository named: DrCH-35.github.io. This specific naming convention is required for GitHub Pages to recognize the repository as a personal website.
I initialized the repository with a README.md and selected the MIT License.

---

## Step 3 â€” Activating GitHub Pages
Inside my repository, I went to: Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Build and Deployment

Selected the main branch
Choose the root directory / (root)
Clicked Save
After a few minutes, my site became available at https://DrCH-35.github.io.

---

## Step 4 â€” Setting Up the Theme
I created a configuration file called _config.yml to define the site theme and title:

title: "C. Hardin's E-Portfolio"
description: "A professional showcase of my work, leadership, and academic projects."
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
This file allows GitHub Pages to render the Markdown files with the Minimal Jekyll Theme.

---

## Step 5 - Creating the Homepage
I edited the existing **index.md** file to introduce my portfolio.

I added my name, a short biography, and links to my rÃ©sumÃ© and projects.
# Welcome to My E-Portfolio
Hello, my name is Clarisa Hardin, and this e-portfolio showcases my educational journey, leadership experience, and professional growth.
I then committed the changes to see them appear live on my website.

---

## Step 6 â€” Adding Other Pages
I created two additional pages:
**portfolio.md** â€” to describe my academic and professional projects
**resume.md** â€” to provide a brief rÃ©sumÃ© summary
Each file uses Markdown headings and links for easy navigation.

---

## Step 7 â€” Previewing Markdown in VS Code

Using Visual Studio Code, I pressed Ctrl + K â†’ V (Windows) to open Markdown Preview in split-view.
This let me see my formatting updates live.

---

## Step 8 â€” Creating Subpages
To organize my work, I created a folder for this guide:
**/milestone2_guide/**

After committing, the subpage appeared at
https://DrCH-35.github.io/milestone2_guide

---

## Step 9 â€” Linking Projects on the Homepage
Within my root index.md, I added:

## Projects
- [Milestone II â€” How I Created My E-Portfolio](./milestone2_guide/)

This provides easy navigation to my Milestone II page.

---

## Step 10 â€” Verification and Submission

I verified:
Home Page: https://DrCH-35.github.io
Subpage: https://DrCH-35.github.io/milestone2_guide both loaded correctly.
Finally, I downloaded the repository as a ZIP file for submission on Canvas.
